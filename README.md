# Teaching DJ how to code

Well, that was a cluster... Mess. of things. Uh... I'm gonna use Codecademy to help teach:

Web pages are created using HTML and CSS. What do these languages do?
- HTML is used to establish a page's structure. It also lets us add text, links and images.
- CSS is used to control the design and layout of the page.

HTML elements are the building blocks of web pages. HTML elements describe each piece of content on a web page so that the web browser knows how to display it.
